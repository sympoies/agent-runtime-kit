# CLI Tools (Cross-Project)

This document is a cross-project reference for CLI tools commonly available in
the Codex and Claude runtimes and recommended usage patterns for development,
testing, and documentation work. Principle: prefer purpose-built tools that
are fast, repo-aware, and emit structured output; avoid ad-hoc pipelines that
are slow or fragile.

Licensing scope note: this is a usage/reference catalog, not a licensing
inventory. Track repo-scoped third-party license obligations in
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.

## Recommended defaults

- Repo-wide search: `rg` (optionally pipe candidates into `fzf`)
- Find files: `fd` (use `tree`/`eza` for human-readable structure listings)
- Read files: `bat`; preview Markdown: `glow`
- Review diffs: `delta` (with `git`)
- API exploration: `xh`/`httpie` + `jq`; use `curl` for minimal-dependency calls
- Browser tooling: native Browser/Chrome tools first; `playwright` for
  deterministic verification; `agent-browser` only as an optional legacy CLI
  fallback
- Structured config/data: `yq`/`jq` (avoid regex parsing for YAML/JSON)
- Agent artifacts: `agent-out` for canonical product `state_home/out/` project
  run directories and layout audits (replaces the legacy `agent-kit`-internal
  out path; the env var that anchored it was removed in Resolved Decision #5)

## External data fetching and MCP browser servers

Agents reach external data through an escalation ladder. Prefer the cheapest
rung that works and climb only when it fails:

1. **Built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (Claude Code native; Codex web search
   when enabled) — the default for documentation, API references, package
   versions, and general lookups. No setup, no key.
2. **Firecrawl MCP** (`npx -y firecrawl-mcp`) — when the built-in fetch cannot
   render a JS/SPA page, or you want LLM-ready Markdown and full-content search
   instead of snippets. Cloud scrape/search API; requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.
3. **Playwright MCP** (`npx @playwright/mcp@latest`) — when the task needs a
   real, scriptable browser: interactive flows, forms, or a logged-in session.
   Runs a local Chromium; no key. For login, reuse an existing signed-in browser
   profile rather than automating credentials.
4. **Heavy anti-bot / CAPTCHA** — do not fight Cloudflare-class protection from a
   headless agent browser. Route it to a dedicated headed-browser crawl
   environment (for example, a real Chrome under a virtual display) instead.

The cloud browser-automation services (Browser Use, Browserbase) and the
scrape/search API (Firecrawl) are reached over MCP or an API key, not installed
as Homebrew formulas, so they are intentionally absent from
`manifests/cli-tools.yaml`.

### MCP server credentials

MCP server configuration is per-user and out of scope for this repo's managed
surfaces (the secret boundary); the `mcp-secret-scan` hook blocks secrets
written into `.mcp.json` or Bash-authored MCP config. Keep API keys out of
version control and out of the config file itself:

- **Claude Code** — `.mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json` expand `${VAR}` at server
  launch, so store the placeholder, not the secret:
  `"env": { "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}" }`.
- **Codex** — `config.toml` does **not** expand `${VAR}`. Forward a named
  variable from Codex's local environment with `env_vars`, which passes it to the
  server without writing the value into the file: `env_vars = ["FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"]`.
- Source the variable from your secrets store or shell environment; never paste
  the literal key into a tracked or scanned file.

## Agent workflow helpers

These are nils-cli binaries shipped through `brew install sympoies/tap/nils-cli`,
not standalone Homebrew formulas. They are therefore not duplicated in
`manifests/cli-tools.yaml`; the `nils-cli` formula provides them as part of one
install. See `docs/source/nils-cli-surface.md` for the pinned binary list.

| `semantic-commit` | Semantic commit validation and staged-context commits | Committing agent-owned changes with auditable message and diff context   | Calling `git commit` directly from agent workflows                |
| `evidence`        | Durable skill-usage evidence archive: migrate / discover / query / search / catalog | Moving skill-usage records out of the ephemeral agent-out tree into the queryable archive, or reading past archived rollups | Treating raw skill-usage records in the agent-out tree as the final, queryable resting place |
